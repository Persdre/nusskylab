### Reporting an issue

We are currently using GitHub issue trackers for  development. You can submit any issues/bugs you want to report through [skylab issue tracker](https://github.com/nusskylab/nusskylab/issues).

### Submitting a patch

For development process, we are mostly following the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html).

⋅⋅⋅Select an issue in our issue tracker, get it assigned to you and create a branch named after the issue(Recommendation Only).
⋅⋅⋅Explanation on the practice: e.g. For Issue 56, you should name your branch "iss56".

2. Add commits
⋅⋅⋅Continuously add commits to the issue branch. During this process, make sure your commit messages are clear and conclude what is each commit about.

3. Open a pull request
⋅⋅⋅Opening a pull request, named after the issue branch, can enable the discussion about the issue.
⋅⋅⋅Requirement of pull-requests' titles: [iss(Issue Number)](Issue Title). e.g. [iss56]use file upload for students csv

4. Discuss and review the patch
⋅⋅⋅The core contributors will start reviewing the patch and possibly clear some doubts about the fix.
